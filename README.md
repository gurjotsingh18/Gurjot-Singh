My first day at college starts with path and kirtan in college's Gurdwara sahib,the whole atmosphere was filled with positivity. After that all the students went to hostel number 2 and had breakfast there.Then following our schedule we all went to auditorium, where principal sir congratulated and encouraged all the students for their new journey towards their career.Then the president of Nankana sahib education trust Mr.Maheshinder Singh guided us to perform well in college.Then after lunch break the professors of our civil engineering department gave us a tour of all the labs and informed us about their significance and what we are going to learn there in our upcoming college years.So, this was our first day at college.
